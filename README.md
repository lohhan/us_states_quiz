# U.S. States Game

This is a quiz game about the U.S. states, created with Python and the Turtle library. The goal of the game is to guess the names of all 50 U.S. states.

## Project Description

This project displays an image of the United States and prompts the user to enter the names of states. When the user enters a correct state name, the state name is displayed in the correct location on the map. The game continues until the user guesses all 50 states or types "Exit" to quit.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. A window will appear with a blank map of the United States.
3. Enter the name of a U.S. state in the dialog box that appears.
4. If the state name is correct, it will be displayed on the map.
5. Continue entering state names until you guess all 50 or type "Exit" to quit the game.
6. If you exit the game, a `missing_states.csv` file will be created with the names of the states you didn't guess.
